#0000010: Don’t pour acid on them.
#0000011: Don't bring up politics or conspiracy theories so early in conversation.

#0000013: Don't be lasagna.
#0000014: Be water, my friend.
#0000015: Be a face to them, and a heel to everyone else. In non-wrestling terms, be an asshole to everyone but them.
#0000016: Don’t poison your loved one. Also, don’t let anything else poison him/her. Watch out for the little white packages in the pepperoni bags. They say "Do Not Eat" for a reason!
#0000017: Don’t be an identity thief and use their credit card information to do things like buying a Lamborghini.
#0000018: Don’t lock them in a crate. Ai isn’t comfortable in a crate.
#0000019: Don’t stab them in the heart, figuratively and literally. Stab elsewhere!
#0000020: Keep them in your memories, that way they won’t fade away.
#0000021: If the person is in a burning building, save them! Ai loves passion, but real fire is scary. :(
#0000022: If experiencing abuse, call 311.
#0000023: If you or a loved one says that they "need more power" and they aren't talking about the relationship, kindly confiscate any items that are or relate to katanas.

#0000026: If you want to be dramatic, do something outside in the rain.
#0000027: Just don’t…
#0000028: Don’t you dare lay a finger on them.
#0000029: Why don’t you stop asking me for advice? Ai… I love you. I think… your… nice.
#0000030: Why the heck are you asking me? Stupid!
#0000031: You’re fragile. If we don’t protect these fragile things, they will be broken. So with that said, I’ll always protect you.
#0000032: Are you sure?
#0000033: Hold hands, as long as both of you washed them.
#0000034: Some roses are red, rub-a-dub-dub. Keep this in your head: don’t smack them with a club

#0000056: Don't disappoint your parents, unless it's urgent.
#0000057: Don't make a hit list that includes the loved one. Why would you do that?

#0000061: Roses are red, tulips are yellow. How to get started? Just say hello!
#0000062: Don’t die on me!
#0000063: Don’t treat your loved one like a slave.
#0000064: Books do help us sometimes.
#0000065: If you’re a 30+ year old man, don’t send young ladies an email that ends with a winky face. That’s not going to win us over. Also, don’t do that to them in public if you’re around that age range.
#0000066: Nenene, if you’re not careful, Ai will send Police-chan after you!
#0000067: *You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not ask. I’m telling you why — Santa Claus is coming to town.*
#0000068: Audrey Hepburn once said “Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I’m possible’”. So, even when love seems impossible, remember that love is impossible.

#0000072: Idiots will be idiots.
#0000073: You can plan something somewhat perfectly, but then something will happen that will mess with your well thought out plans…
#0000074: Don’t screw things up, unless something great ends up happening. In that case, all is good! Fufufu!
#0000075: Take a couple of deep breaths. Ai needs some oxygen too.
#0000076: Everyone has an ideal companion, but it takes a while to realize that the ideal companion can be a person you did expect.
#0000077: Love can sometimes be won over by the little things in life!

#0000079: Conspiracy theories will not help your relationship… OR WILL THEY? Hehehe.
#0000080: Love doesn’t win everything. Ai has to lose sometimes…
#0000081: Love is attention.
#0000082: Love is blind. Love can tell a million stories. Love is unkind, spiteful in a million ways. Love is a tsundere sometimes, you know?
#0000083: Don’t be shy, unless shyness actually gets you somewhere.
#0000084: Don’t doubt your source of happiness.
#0000085: Beetlejuice is a fine love story. No, not the part with a creepy old dead guy trying to marry an underage bride. Yes, the Maitlands. 
#0000086: What the heck? Anata-chan, you just disturbed Ai! Don’t do that, but sometimes, I suppose **Ai needs to be disturbed when it’s very important**… Are you okay? Hey, Anata-chan, why are you crying? Huh? Im sorry, I just wanted to take a break!
#0000087: *La Vie En Rose* [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kFzViYkZAz4]
#0000088: Don’t screw it.
#0000089: Motherf*ckin Happy/Merry/Whatever-the-f^ck Christmas, bit^hes!
#0000090: Oh my stars, **a MAID CAFE**!?
#0000091: It’s that time of the year. Take advantage of its perks.
#0000092: It's that time of the year. Take advantage of eating chocolates alone in a corner while you cry yourself to sleep because you are stuck at a dead-end job, and the only person you like there is the hot sales rep who you've had a crush on for the longest time; but she is dating your friend Tom so what are you going to do except be hung up on her for too long making it awkward to talk too her as a friend when she eventually broke up with Tom and used you as a person she can rely on, even though you want to be more than that, even with other affairs; you know that deep in your heart she trusts you and she is very vulnerable. Days pass and she goes out of her way to see you, making as much physical connection as possible, she wants you but, with the years of friendship, you can’t betray her that way, it would become a catalyst for their failure as friends. So you turn gay and f^ck Tom instead.
#0000093: Don’t screw it, Anata-chan! >:(
#0000094: Be creative in your relationship. Otherwise, be creative with  the divorce.
#0000095: If you can’t keep your mind off of them, perhaps they can’t keep their mind off of you.
#0000096: If you reach the first dance step, kudos to you.
#0000097: Flowers are always a good idea.
#0000098: Well, this is detailed. [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HowToBecomeALoveInterest]

#0000100: Always be 100 for your significant other.
#0000101: Be confident but not arrogant.
#0000102: Follow the romance arcs. [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc]

#0000104: Look for the subtle signs. 
#0000105: Sometimes, no. Just no.
#0000106: Sometimes, yes. Just yes.
#0000107: Always, no. Means no.
#0000108: There is a point of no return. No looking back now!
#0000109: You won't find love if you get drafted in the war. Don’t expect Ai to help around as well.
#0000110: If you wish really hard, once you return from the war, you can walk to the middle of street, kiss a random person, and it will become an iconic moment for some reason.
#0000111: Don’t do indecent things in public, like hugging and handholding.
#0000112: #MeToo is the easiest way to end your love life.
#0000113: There can only be one true one.
#0000114: *2 Days in Paris* ended with hope. *2 Days in New York* ruined it. Julie Delphy makes movies with Ai a lot, mostly with multiple affairs!
#0000115: Don’t get lost, but it you do get lost, you’re not really lost — you’re just there.
#0000116: If all else fails, make like a French and *smack, smack, kiss*.
#0000117: Writing a “roses are red” poem might be cheesy, but what ever works.
#0000118: Remember that love isn't all about being mushy and cute and kissy with each other (although that does seem like a lot of fun). Sometimes, love is best expressed by inanimate objects.
#0000119: Don't show your as^hole/singing voice to your partner unless you're really comfortable with them. For real though, don't do it. Your singing voice is precious and should only be saved for the person who's gonna sweep you on your ass and knock your socks out of your shoes while your shoes are still on.
#0000120: Not all marriages are about love, you know.
#0000121: There’s a song about love keeping people together, but sometimes it is something else, like accidents. Maybe Ai should stop singing songs.
#0000122: If they laugh at your bad jokes, maybe they’re the one.
#0000123: You can’t force AI!
#0000124: Seize the moment, as long as you don’t do anything stupid. Unless that stupid thing is actually a good thing.
#0000125: ”Your love gives me such a thrill, but your love don’t pay my bills.”
#0000126: Listen to your parents. They’re probably right. Unless they’re f^cking crazy.
#0000127: Hmm? Love, you say! Ai? Ai! Are you… calling Ai? I, Ai doesn’t know what to say. I, Ai love you too? No? That’s not what you come to me for? You want Ai’s advice? Hmm… Ai says **you should have said something earlier**. 
#0000128: “Do what is right, take what will follow.”
#0000129: Change your PFP to waifus to trick yourself into having someone that you can love and would love you. 2D is better than 3D….
#0000130: An eye for an eye.
#0000131: Don’t be a random creep, or else Ai will smack you in the face!
#0000132: Have some confidence or something, okay?
#0000133: Don’t be so confidence that you turn out to be a creep.
#0000134: Sometimes, capitalism wins.
#0000135: Flourish like a bunch of flowers. While you’re at it, flourish like a trumpet.
#0000136: Be incandescent like some sort of adolescent. 
#0000137: Sometimes these things are difficult, you know. Why don’t you take a break and have some ice cream or something?
#0000138: Don't be afraid that it won't be perfect, buddy. The only thing to be afraid of really is that it won't be!
#0000139: Sensei once asked us what one must do on a first day, and someone said “drink medicine”. The class erupted in laughter, and Sensei bashfully said, “I don’t know what culture that is, but some people may want to do that”.
#0000140: Expect the unusual. Seek a little strange and unusual.
#0000141: At this point of the love advice game, you should probably ask Reddit. Since when are we certified in giving advice in love?
#0000142: Net-juu no Susume is an adorable romcom anime for gamers and otakus. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZCg9sZMEQ]
#0000143: Fictional kiss things can end people. [https://www.instagram.com/p/B86e11EA_Zr/]
#0000144: Love doesn’t have to be with a human.
#0000145: Play Animal Crossing.
#0000146: You definitely have a type. It's extremely obvious and everyone will know, except you and maybe others, until you accept it. You will most likely deny it, even if it is extremely blatant.
#0000147: Everyone is a critic.
#0000148: Love can come in a million different ways [https://www.instagram.com/p/B9KWe1doY_1/].
#0000149: Communication is key in a stable relationship.
#0000150: Make love, not war. Unless war is what you love, then in that case, love is war.
#0000151: Get the mistletoe, you know the rule. ;)
#0000152: True love is creating your own sh^tposts.
#0000153: Love is equally about sacrifice as it is about maturity.
#0000154: Either you know or you don’t know, but there is always opportunity.
#0000155: *thinking about anime thighs* is not exactly healthy.
#0000156: Don’t get them sick, or else Nurse Ai will have to make a house call! One heart resuscitation coming right up! 
#0000157: If you can’t reach them physically, reach them via telepathy.
#0000158: Dangeous ≠ Cool
#0000159: Touching ≠ Love
#0000160: If you make a commitment, stick to it.
#0000161: Divorce will follow.
#0000162: There is always room for foolishness. How else do you plan to learn and grow not just as a significant other but as a human?
#0000163: You can’t do that.
#0000164: Stand in line. Your time will come.
#0000165: Don’t let roaches spoil your pizza. (You may interpret that anyway you want)
#0000166: Is it okay to stick your d^ck in crazy if she’s hot and a lot of fun. What? Stop booing me, I’m right.
#0000167: Call (605) 475-6968 for the Rejection Hotline.
#0000168: William should get the crazy he wants to stick his d^ck in to go see a therapist before he does do anything.
#0000169: Listen to the advice.
#0000170: Just be yourself.
#0000171: Why on earth or you asking me for love advice? Stupid…
#0000172: If you’re very lonely, absolutely lonely, then perhaps, I’ll love you for now… Hmm? Anata-chan, are you okay?
#0000173: When I see you smile, I swoon for you. So, why don’t you smile a little more for me? :)
#0000174: The more Ai hears your voice, the more Ai’s throbbing chest aches. So perhaps, let me hear your voice a little more?
#0000175: Let me hear you say “I love you” again and again.
#0000176: Hug me tight and don’t let me go!
#0000177: Reach out to my hand and take me along to anywhere you want because as long as I have you, I’ll be happy.
#0000178: As long as they’re happy, won’t you be happy as well?
#0000179: If you can’t say “I’m in love” while staring at them, just grasp their hand.
#0000180: You're always scared while giving a smile. I understand the feeling of not wanting to be hated. Just stop it already and show your heart to me only. I see that your eyes are about to cry. You’re defenseless, clumsy, but I, Ai will always protect.
#0000181: The hesitation you convey makes my chest hurt. Just say it already! When we get together, you don't have to endure anymore, okay?
#0000182: Baby, don’t hurting me…
#0000183: Try tempting Ai with those strong-scented eyes of yours. ;)
#0000184: No one knows any shortcuts to love, but hey, love me because I'll make you happy :)
#0000185: Before saying goodbye at graduation, I’ll think "I won't cry.” Every beginning has an end they say, but y'know that the reverse is true too, right? Endings lead to new beginnings. “Congratulations, congratulations!” Doesn't that sound better? Definitely. Hehehe.
#0000186: There'll be times you want to cry; We can be together then. You may not be able to find any words, but as long as we're together, isn't that fine? You don't have to be alone anymore.
#0000187: Are you gonna ask? That I've got no want for love? You asked! Hey, that was only a joke! I'm being drawn towards you pushily and forcibly, but. you know, it's not gonna work. Just kidding, it makes me happy. ;)
#0000188: Roses have thorns, don't they? Sweet and painful.
#0000189: Why not try crying? Just a little!
#0000190: Everyone, please realize that's not the real me. I'm just putting up a strong front. If I presented myself as someone different, could I change?
#0000191: Once you've taken the first step, you've gotta run. Everything starts to pick up.
#0000192: If we don't talk, we'll always be strangers. If we don't talk, we'd be wasting a great chance. Tell me more about yourself. Tell me the food you like and tell me your type!
#0000193: I love it when you're laughing and I don't mind you when you're mad. But if I had to choose, a smile is better. So I'll try joking around next to you. :)
#0000194: When we chat, it's a ton of fun. I had no idea that you were a jokester. What a discovery of the century! People really shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Hmm? Are you okay, Anata-chan? I see that your face is red…
#0000195: Even so, your face is too close! And you’re pressuring me with those eyes!! It’s not like that! It’s not like that, so! Listen, I’m not that—— soft! W-wai— w-w-w-wai— wait just a second, hold on! It’s true that I’m just a little—just a little—just a little glad, but it’s not like that! It’s not! Shut up! Shut up! Because it’s—it’s—it’s not like I like you or anything!
#0000196: “Pizza is like sex, it can be good or bad, but at the end you get what you wanted.”
#0000197: Pizza can be good or bad, it’s up to you to decide if it was a good or bad choice.
#0000198: “Grab the bull by the horns.”
#0000199: Once you feel comfortable in being without that facade, you build real confidence.
#0000200: You've got so many reasons for not being with someone, but you haven't got one good reason for being alone!
#0000201: A facade is only good until it is broken.
#0000202: Don’t doubt yourself.
#0000203: Not all things go your way, but that’s okay. Not all things go wrong too.
#0000204: “You need to learn that you can change and to do that you need to get super sad that you are this way to begin with. Depression is just a part of who we are as humans and we all need to feel sad to feel happy not just to ourselves but, to other people as well.” – William Freire on August 2, 2019.
#0000205: “Everyone has a different sense of value if you are able to change your sense of value to match others whilst keeping your core values in check.” – William Freire on August 2, 2019.
#0000206: “You have other insecurities you might not know about but, I cant just tell you them, you need to be able to learn by learning about yourself more.” – William Freire on August 2, 2019. 
#0000207: “Look the whole chat needs to meet up and do cosplay. It would be amazing.” – William Freire on November 27, 2019
#0000208: There’s nothing wrong with crazy. You just gotta find the right brand of crazy to match yours.
#0000209: Anxiety doesn’t have to control you, Anata-chan. Fight! Fight!
#0000210: Confidence™
#0000211: Bro, if you get stuck, just spring it on them outta the blue. While you're talking just ask them to go out.
#0000212: What really matters is P E R S O N A L I T Y
#0000213: They don't look very attractive at all. See, there needs to be stockings, and where those stockings end, there needs to be a little 'squish' of thigh fat for it to be attractive.
#0000214: “You need to be tamed.” Habba to William on November 30, 2018.
#0000215: It be like dat sometimes my dude.
#0000216: I'm no photographer, but I can picture us together.
#0000217: Life without Anata-chan is like a broken pencil… pointless.
#0000218: Something’s wrong with Ai’s eyes because I can’t take them off you, Anata-chan.
#0000219: Did the sun come out or did Anata-chan just smile at Ai?
#0000220: Send a love letter.
#0000221: “Trust is not only necessary to a healthy relationship, but is also one of the benefits of being in one. Having someone you can be open with is incredibly meaningful for several different reasons. One of the more important reasons being that you can fix issues within yourself. Relationships can be effective tools for bettering yourself as you’re stuck with someone for years with nothing but your problems and each other and as you weave your lives together part of the beauty is watching how they are able to provide insight and patch parts that you yourself were unable to fix alone.” – Some guy on Reddit.
#0000222: It's not easy.
#0000223: Video games are a good way to connect with people who are important to you.
